# Microcontrollers

In this directory you will find: 

- The circuits of the node.
- The codes of the Pygate, Fipy, and Arduino.

## [Arduino]()

We have first configured an Arduino for testing sensors, so we have added the code to use these sensors with Arduino.

## [Pycom]

Pycom is a company that produces microcontrollers that can be configured to work with multiples RF and servers. Their microcontrollers are based on the ESP32 and use Micropython as the coding language.

### [Node configuration - FiPy + Expansion board]()

For the node we have used the FiPy and the 3V expansion board. This microcontroller will be connected to the sensors and will send measurements to the cloud.

### [Pygate]()

The Pygate it's a shield for the microcontrollers produced by Pycom. It will be the gate between the messages sent from the node and the Things Network.
