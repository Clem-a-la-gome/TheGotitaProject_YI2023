# The Gotita Project - Young Innovators 2023

This repository has been made in the context of the 2023 edition of the Young Innovator scholarship granted by the Colombian ministry of science. My ambition is to create a water quality monitoring system for rural isolated zones.

## Problem Statement

In 2017, an estimated of 1.2 million people died as a result of unsafe water sources. This was 2.2% of global deaths. More particularly, In Colombia 1.2 million of people have no access to clean and safe water and 150 children are dying per year because of diarrhoea, a higly related desease to bad water quality consumption. There are 391 municipalities already at risk of water shortages. Chocó, Huila, Nariño and Bolívar are 4 departments that have been recently in maximum alert. Since the use of water treatment at the household level and its adequate storage is very widespread and can be in remote, dispersed, difficult to access and difficult to manage areas, it is difficult to monitor the correct operation and maintenance.

For this reason, multiples NGOs are now trying to improve this aspect and improve life quality of those who lived in undeserved areas. Nevertheless, there are too much challenges that WASH units are facing now.

For this, we need to ensure the water quality of the source and the distribution point after treament.

## Proposal for the young innovator scholarship of 2023

The idea is to measure  water quality variables and aloud the user to visualize the data and have previous records through an online data base. 

To collect the data, we will use electronic sensors that will measure water quality variables. Measures will then be sent through LoRaWAN protocole to a data base platform where data will be stored. After having the data stored in the platform, we will visualize the data through a WebApp.

**Measured variables:**
- Ph
- Temperature
- Water Level
- Turbidity
- Conductivity
- Dissolved Oxygen
